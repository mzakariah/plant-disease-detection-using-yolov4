# plant-disease-detection-using-yolov4
our work focused on the detection and identification of plant leaf diseases using the YOLO v4 architecture on the Plant Village dataset. Through the use of image annotation, data preprocessing, and model training, we were able to achieve very good accuracy in detecting and identifying various plant leaf diseases.
