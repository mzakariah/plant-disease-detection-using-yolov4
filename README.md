# plant-disease-detection-using-yolov4
our work focused on the detection and identification of plant leaf diseases using the YOLO v4 architecture on the Plant Village dataset. Through the use of image annotation, data preprocessing, and model training, we were able to achieve very good accuracy in detecting and identifying various plant leaf diseases.

The YOLO v4 architecture proved to be effective in detecting and localizing the diseased regions in plant leaf images. We also experimented with different hyperparameters and model configurations to optimize the performance of the model.

Our work contributes to the growing body of research on the use of deep learning techniques in plant disease detection and shows the potential for YOLO v4 in this domain. In future work, we aim to expand the scope of our approach to other plant diseases and datasets and explore the integration of other deep-learning techniques to further improve the performance of the model.

our work highlights the importance of utilizing advanced computer vision techniques for the accurate and timely detection of plant diseases, which is crucial for ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture.
